Comp 20 Assignment 4

1. I believe all aspects of the work have been implemented correctly, however I do wish I had found more things wrong. I spent a fair amount of time looking for issues and had a lot of trouble finding any besides the XSS which was rather blatant.

2. I disscused some aspects of this briefly with Anzu Hakone who's code I was looking at.

3. I spent about 2.5 hours on this assignment.
