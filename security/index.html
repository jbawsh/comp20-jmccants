		<p>By James McCants<p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2> 

		<h2>Methodology</h2>

		<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

		<h2>Issues Found</h2>
			<h4>1. XSS</h4>

				<p>This is attack is quite dangerous because it can lead to invalid data for third party users as well as allow unauthorized people to manipulate the product.</p>

				<p>Using the /sendLoactions API one can pass whatever they want into a field, for instance script tags with valid JS, and then when that is accessed later it will run the javascript.</p>

				<img src="images/XSS.png" alt="example of an alert placed via XSS">

				<p>This can be resolved by escaping user input before storing it so that potentially dangerous characters can be escaped to their HTML components. This way they will still be displayed correctly when accessed but not mistaken for javascript or something else nasty.</p>

			<h4>2. Bad JSON</h4>

			<h4>3. Add extra data</h4>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
